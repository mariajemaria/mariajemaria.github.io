title: "Broken TinyMCE functionality for Optimizely CMS: image cannot be added through Insert/edit image"

Recently, we got a bug report from the customer suggesting that when Insert/edit image is used from TinyMCE, the Source is not updated after the image is actually chosen.

![Broken insert image with TinyMCE](/assets/images/broken-editor.png)

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. In CMS open any page or block that has TinyMCE 
2. Try to add image via TinyMCEâ€™s "Insert/Edit Image" popup (using drag & drop is working properly)
3. Click on the search icon and select an image from the Assets

**Observed**: when the image is chosen, source field is not populated and as a result image will not be added.

While we were trying to find which TinyMCE plugin exactly was causing the error, we upgraded EPiServer.CMS.TinyMce from 2.13.4 to 2.13.8 and that alone was enough to fix the issue.

I have not been able to find this on the Optimizely World, so decided to share.
