My name is Marija Jemuovic, an Optimizely developer and architect. I hold a MSc degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from ETF in Belgrade, Serbia.

I used to work at a Swedish company called Mogul since 2010 with Episerver as well as custom .NET based solutions. In 2014, I have been awarded with Optimizely Most Valued Professional (Episerver at that time) award for my community contributions, which I proudly hold today.

In April 2018, I have happily joined one of the best companies focusing on Optimizely Commerce, Geta Digital as Geta Serbia country manager, leading a group of 20 smart and talented people.

During my student days, I was an active member of EESTEC, which gave me a great opportunity to lead an International organization of 2000 students together with my boardies. Ever since 2007, I've been delivering soft skills trainings on motivation, communication and leadership.

I adore nature, hiking, skiing as well as playing board games (I recommend Avalon at least twice a month), singing (at least twice a day) and a bit of cooking every now and then.

I am a mom of a very eloquent three year old boy.
